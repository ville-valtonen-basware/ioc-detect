A bash script to detect indicators of compromise from the September 2025 npm supply chain attacks, including the Shai-Hulud self-replicating worm and the chalk/debug crypto theft attack. This comprehensive detector covers 571+ compromised package versions across multiple attack campaigns, providing protection against the most severe JavaScript supply chain attacks to date.

## Overview

This detector covers multiple npm supply chain attacks from September 2025:

### 🎯 **Chalk/Debug Crypto Theft Attack** (September 8, 2025)
- **Scope**: 18+ packages with 2+ billion weekly downloads
- **Attack**: Cryptocurrency wallet address replacement in browsers
- **Duration**: ~2 hours before detection
- **Packages**: chalk, debug, ansi-styles, color-*, supports-*, and others
- **Method**: XMLHttpRequest hijacking to steal crypto transactions

### 🐛 **Shai-Hulud Self-Replicating Worm** (September 14-16, 2025)
- **Scope**: 517+ packages across multiple namespaces
- **Attack**: Credential harvesting and self-propagation
- **Method**: Uses Trufflehog to scan for secrets, publishes stolen data to GitHub
- **Propagation**: Self-replicates using stolen npm tokens
- **Packages**: @ctrl/*, @crowdstrike/*, @operato/*, and many others

The script detects indicators from both attacks to provide comprehensive protection against these sophisticated supply chain compromises.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository (required for compromised package list)
git clone https://github.com/username/shai-hulud-detector.git
cd shai-hulud-detector

# Make the script executable
chmod +x shai-hulud-detector.sh

# Scan your project for Shai-Hulud indicators
./shai-hulud-detector.sh /path/to/your/project

# For comprehensive security scanning
./shai-hulud-detector.sh --paranoid /path/to/your/project
```

## What it Detects

### High Risk Indicators
- **Malicious workflow files**: `shai-hulud-workflow.yml` files in `.github/workflows/`
- **Known malicious file hashes**: Files matching any of 7 SHA-256 hashes from different Shai-Hulud worm variants (V1-V7), sourced from [Socket.dev's comprehensive attack analysis](https://socket.dev/blog/ongoing-supply-chain-attack-targets-crowdstrike-npm-packages)
- **Compromised package versions**: Specific versions of 571+ packages from multiple attacks
- **Suspicious postinstall hooks**: Package.json files with postinstall scripts containing curl, wget, or eval commands
- **Trufflehog activity**: Files containing trufflehog references or credential scanning patterns
- **Shai-Hulud repositories**: Git repositories named "Shai-Hulud" (used for data exfiltration)

### Medium Risk Indicators
- **Suspicious content patterns**: References to `webhook.site` and the malicious endpoint `bb8ca5f6-4175-45d2-b042-fc9ebb8170b7`
- **Suspicious git branches**: Branches named "shai-hulud"
- **Compromised namespaces**: Packages from namespaces known to be affected (@ctrl, @crowdstrike, @art-ws, @ngx, @nativescript-community)

## Compromised Packages Detected

The script detects compromised packages from multiple September 2025 attacks. **Our current detection covers 571+ confirmed compromised packages** with specific version numbers, plus broader namespace detection for comprehensive protection.

### Package Detection Method

The script loads compromised packages from an external file (`compromised-packages.txt`) which contains:
- **571+ confirmed compromised package versions** with exact version numbers
- **11 affected namespaces** for broader detection of packages from compromised maintainer accounts

### Key Compromised Packages Include
- `@ctrl/tinycolor@4.1.1, 4.1.2` - Shai-Hulud attack vector (2M+ weekly downloads)
- `chalk@5.6.1`, `debug@4.4.2` - Chalk/Debug crypto theft attack (2B+ weekly downloads)
- `@art-ws/*` packages (16+ packages) - Art workspace utilities
- `@crowdstrike/*` packages (25+ packages) - CrowdStrike-related packages
- `@nativescript-community/*` packages (40+ packages) - NativeScript community tools
- `ngx-bootstrap`, `angulartics2`, `koa2-swagger-ui` - Popular standalone packages

### Affected Namespaces (Complete List)
- `@ctrl/*` - Control utility packages
- `@crowdstrike/*` - CrowdStrike-related packages
- `@art-ws/*` - Art workspace packages
- `@ngx/*` - Angular-related packages
- `@nativescript-community/*` - NativeScript community packages
- `@ahmedhfarag/*`, `@operato/*`, `@teselagen/*`, `@things-factory/*`, `@hestjs/*`, `@nstudio/*` - Additional affected namespaces

### Maintaining and Updating the Package List

**Important**: The Shai-Hulud attack was self-replicating, meaning new compromised packages may still be discovered. The compromised packages list is stored in `compromised-packages.txt` for easy maintenance:

- **Format**: `package_name:version` (one per line)
- **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` are ignored
- **Updates**: The file can be updated as new compromised packages are discovered
- **Fallback**: If the file is missing, the script uses a core embedded list

### Staying Updated on New Compromised Packages

Check these security advisories regularly for newly discovered compromised packages:

- **[StepSecurity Blog](https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised)** - Original comprehensive analysis
- **[Semgrep Security Advisory](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/security-advisory-npm-packages-using-secret-scanning-tools-to-steal-credentials/)** - Detailed technical analysis

- **[Socket.dev Blog](https://socket.dev/blog/ongoing-supply-chain-attack-targets-crowdstrike-npm-packages)** - CrowdStrike package analysis

### How to Add Newly Discovered Packages

1. Check the security advisories above for new compromised packages
2. Add them to `compromised-packages.txt` in the format `package_name:version`
3. Test the script to ensure detection works
4. Consider contributing updates back to this repository

**Coverage Note**: Multiple September 2025 attacks affected 571+ packages total. Our detection aims to provide **comprehensive coverage** across both the Shai-Hulud worm (517+ packages) and Chalk/Debug crypto theft (26+ packages) attacks. Combined with namespace-based detection, this should provide excellent protection against these sophisticated supply chain compromises.

### Core vs Paranoid Mode

**Core Mode (Default)**
- Focuses specifically on Shai-Hulud attack indicators
- Recommended for most users checking for this specific threat
- Clean, focused output with minimal false positives

**Paranoid Mode (`--paranoid`)**
- Includes all core Shai-Hulud detection PLUS additional security checks
- Adds typosquatting detection and network exfiltration pattern analysis
- ⚠️ **Important**: Paranoid features are general security tools, not specific to Shai-Hulud
- May produce more false positives from legitimate code
- Useful for comprehensive security auditing

## Requirements

- macOS or Unix-like system
- Bash shell
- Standard Unix tools: `find`, `grep`, `shasum`

## Output Interpretation

### Clean System
```
✅ No indicators of Shai-Hulud compromise detected.
Your system appears clean from this specific attack.
```

### Compromised System
The script will show:
- **🚨 HIGH RISK**: Definitive indicators of compromise
- **⚠️ MEDIUM RISK**: Suspicious patterns requiring manual review
- **Summary**: Count of issues found

### What to Do if Issues are Found

#### High Risk Issues
- **Immediate action required**
- Update or remove compromised packages
- Review and remove malicious workflow files
- Scan for credential theft
- Consider full system audit

#### Medium Risk Issues
- **Manual investigation needed**
- Review flagged files for legitimacy
- Check if webhook.site usage is intentional
- Verify git branch purposes

## Testing

The repository includes test cases to validate the script:

```bash
# Test on clean project (should show no issues)
./shai-hulud-detector.sh test-cases/clean-project

# Test on infected project (should show multiple issues)
./shai-hulud-detector.sh test-cases/infected-project

# Test on mixed project (should show medium risk issues)
./shai-hulud-detector.sh test-cases/mixed-project

# Test legitimate crypto libraries (should show MEDIUM risk only)
./shai-hulud-detector.sh test-cases/legitimate-crypto

# Test chalk/debug attack patterns (should show HIGH risk)
./shai-hulud-detector.sh test-cases/chalk-debug-attack

# Test common crypto libraries (should not trigger HIGH risk false positives)
./shai-hulud-detector.sh test-cases/common-crypto-libs
```

## How it Works

The script performs these comprehensive checks:

1. **Package Database Loading**: Loads the complete list of 571+ compromised packages from `compromised-packages.txt`
2. **Workflow Detection**: Searches for `shai-hulud-workflow.yml` files in `.github/workflows/`
3. **Hash Verification**: Calculates SHA-256 hashes of JavaScript/JSON files against 7 known malicious bundle.js variants representing the complete evolution of the Shai-Hulud worm (V1-V7)
4. **Package Analysis**: Parses `package.json` files for specific compromised versions and affected namespaces
5. **Postinstall Hook Detection**: Identifies suspicious postinstall scripts that could be used for malware propagation
6. **Content Scanning**: Greps for suspicious URLs, webhook endpoints, and malicious patterns
7. **Cryptocurrency Theft Detection**: Identifies wallet address replacement patterns, XMLHttpRequest hijacking, and known crypto theft functions from the September 8 attack
8. **Trufflehog Activity Detection**: Looks for evidence of credential scanning tools and secret harvesting
9. **Git Analysis**: Checks for suspicious branch names and repository names
10. **Repository Detection**: Identifies "Shai-Hulud" repositories used for data exfiltration
11. **Package Integrity Checking**: Analyzes package-lock.json and yarn.lock files for compromised packages and suspicious modifications

## Limitations

- **Hash Detection**: Only detects files with exact matches to the 7 known malicious bundle.js hashes
- **Package Versions**: Detects specific compromised versions and namespace warnings, but new compromised versions may not be detected
- **False Positives**: Legitimate use of webhook.site, Trufflehog for security, or postinstall hooks will trigger alerts
- **Worm Evolution**: The self-replicating nature means new variants may emerge with different signatures
- **Coverage**: Covers known compromised packages from major September 2025 attacks
- **Package Integrity**: Relies on lockfile analysis to detect compromised packages, but sophisticated attacks may evade detection

## Contributing

If you discover additional IoCs or compromised packages related to the Shai-Hulud attack, please update the arrays in the script and test thoroughly.

## Security Note

This script is for **detection only**. It does not:
- Automatically remove malicious code
- Fix compromised packages
- Prevent future attacks

Always verify findings manually and take appropriate remediation steps.

## Latest Threat Intelligence Updates
